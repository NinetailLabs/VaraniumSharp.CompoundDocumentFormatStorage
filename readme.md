# VaraniumSharp.CompoundDocumentFormatStorage

VaraniumSharp.CompoundDocumentFormatStorage is a VaraniumSharp add-on that implements the [IPackageManager](https://ninetaillabs.github.io/VaraniumSharp/api/VaraniumSharp.Interfaces.Collections.IPackageManager.html) using [OpenMCDF](http://openmcdf.sourceforge.net/). This results in a package manager with less disk access and an immunity to corruption compared to the implementation in VaraniumSharp that uses ZipArchive.
